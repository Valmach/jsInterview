#Section 1: Grammar

1. What data types does Javascript provide?
A: Six primitive types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, Symbol (new in ECMAScrpt 6) and Objects. 
   
   Number: the double precision 64-bit binary format; 3 symbolic values: +Infinity, -Infinity and NaN

   String: immutable. a set of 16-bit unsigned integer values.

   Symbol: unique and immutable primitive value

   Object: a keyed collection of properties

   use typeof to know the data type

   p.s. You may argue that typeof(null) returns 'object', this is a bug to be fixed.

 2. What values are falsy?
 A: false, 0, null, undefined, '', NaN; Others are true including 'false'

 3. How to create an object?
 A: use literal like 
	 var person = {
         id: 123,
         sex: 'male',
         'first-name': 'Ed',
         'last-name': 'Green'
	 };

  4. What is closure?
  A: A closure is a function having access to its parent scope, even after the parent function has closed. 

  5. What is JSON? What is the difference between a javascript object and a JSON data?
  A: JSON is JavaScript Object Notation, a data interchange format. JSON is a syntax. JSON data is text only though it uses JavaScript data format.
  
  6. What is prototype? How to inherit from an object in javascript?

  7. How to define a function?
  A: var func = function(){}; function func(){}
